## Developer Portfolio
This is a single-page application portfolio that allows potential employers to view a web developer's work samples. It provides a user-friendly interface with various sections and functionalities. The application is built using React.

## User Story
As an employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications, I want to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples so that I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

## Acceptance Criteria
When I load the portfolio, I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer.
When I view the header, I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio.
When I view the navigation titles, I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted.
When I click on a navigation title, I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading, and that title is highlighted.
When I load the portfolio for the first time, the About Me title and section are selected by default.
When I am presented with the About Me section, I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them.
When I am presented with the Portfolio section, I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository.
When I am presented with the Contact section, I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message.
When I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text, I receive a notification that this field is required.
When I enter text into the email address field, I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address.
When I am presented with the Resume section, I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies.
When I view the footer, I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter).
